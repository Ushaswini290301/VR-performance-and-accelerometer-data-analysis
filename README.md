# VR-performance-and-accelerometer-data-analysis
This project analyzes the correlation between cognitive function (Block Design Scores) and VR task completion times, introducing new metrics like average time per step and pauses. It also evaluates accelerometer-derived movement measures (M2) against traditional clinical assessments, providing clinically relevant insights.
